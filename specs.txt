On this document we will list and categorize some longterm goals for the project so that we can better know
and plan for what we're building towards. 

Functionality (up for debate):
  1) I'd like the shell to feel similar to Bash and PS, that way users of the two can easily pick up how
     to use this one and write scripts with it like any other shell. The main difference is that it will
     be open source, so users can do more than simply modify a config file to modify it. This means:
       i)    Similar syntax
       ii)   Fully scriptable language (including comments and Wildcard support)
       iii)  Shell arguments implicate running in script mode
       iv)   Environment variables
       v)    Options for Inter-process communication
       vi)   Any other nice bells and whistles we find (to be continued...)
   2) The support for config files is very light as of now. In addition to custom command libraries, I'd like to 
      add a few other things to allow the config file to support a fully customizable startup environment:
       i)    Aliases
       ii)   Changes to the interface (font colors, dimensions, etc)
       iii)  Startup scripts
       iv)   And more (to be continued...)
